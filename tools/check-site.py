"""Fail if the site has broken an invariant that a file diff cannot see.

HISTORY. HEAD-COMMON, NAV, FOOTER and SCRIPTS used to be literally duplicated in
every page, and most of this script existed to catch them drifting apart. They
now live once in `_layouts/default.html` and GitHub Pages assembles the pages
with Jekyll, so drift is no longer possible and that check is gone.

What is NOT gone is the reason the check existed. The 2026-07-29 relaunch shipped
three bugs, and only one of them was drift:

  * three pages whose font URL had lost `&family=Chewy`, so the 37vw footer
    wordmark fell back to system cursive — at metrics the -3.3vw nudge was not
    tuned for, which clipped it out of its own overflow:hidden box;
  * a `.kk-footer{display:grid}` rule (0,1,0) that silently out-specified the
    mobile `footer{display:block}` override (0,0,1), so the footer overlay was
    never undone on phones;
  * nav markup switched to an `.is-open` class while kk-nav.js still drove the
    `hidden` attribute.

The last two are invariants, not duplication, and they are still checked here —
now against the layout, which is the only copy. Two more were added later, each
after costing real time:

  * a stray `}` in the stylesheet, which makes the CSS parser discard the rule
    that FOLLOWS it. It cost `.kk-loop-grid` its `display:grid` and the symptom
    appeared nowhere near the cause;
  * inline `style=` attributes, 173 of which were lifted into named classes so
    the copy is findable. One added back is not a problem; fifty are.

    python tools/check-site.py

Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = at least one failure.
